WeatherPy is a project based on analyzing weather patterns across 500 different cities to determine if there were patterns related to weather the closer one got to the equator.

This project involved utilizing the OpenWeather API to gather data on 500 different randomly determined cities. The data was then placed in a data frame and used to create four different charts that measured a relationship between location and cloudiness, location and temperature, location and humidity, and location and wind speed.
